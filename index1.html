          It was a coincidence that Apollo, the heavyweight black boxing champion of the United States, was chosen as
          his opponent.

          <h2> Film evaluation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The film is simple in structure and sincere in emotion,
          which can especially inspire the audience to sympathize with the weak.
          Although the film is a small production, without any big scenes,
          no trace of meticulous, but full of primitive beauty, performance,
          lines and music are quite in place.
          Rocky highlights the American spirit with a story of American dream.
          As a humble figure in the lower class, his life is calm and plain,
          and he seems to be a bit dull and old-fashioned.
          But when the world boxing champion decides to regard him as a sandbag to improve his reputation,
          his inner spirit of never giving up is revealed,
          and the hard training proves it The spirit that a man should embody when facing great pressure and challenge.
          Rocky shows this indomitable spirit through the film,
          and some parts of this spirit are obviously beyond national boundaries.
